# Local Profile Config

## Setup Instructions

Before running TP overlap tuning, create the required config files:

1. Copy sample configs from parent directory:
   ```bash
   cp ../override_model_config.json ./
   cp ../override_tf_config.json ./
   ```

2. Modify as needed:
   - `override_model_config.json`: Override HuggingFace model params (usually empty `{}`)
   - `override_tf_config.json`: Override TransformerConfig params
   - `tp_comm_overlap_cfg.yaml`: Auto-generated by tuner (do not create manually)

## Required Files

```
.
├── override_model_config.json  (required, can be empty {})
├── override_tf_config.json     (required, use {"tp_comm_overlap": false} initially)
└── tp_comm_overlap_cfg.yaml    (auto-generated by tuner)
```

## Configuration Details

### override_model_config.json
This file overrides model parameters fetched from HuggingFace. In most cases, leave it as an empty JSON object `{}` to use the default model configuration.

Example:
```json
{

}
```

### override_tf_config.json
This file overrides TransformerConfig parameters. For TP overlap tuning, start with `tp_comm_overlap` set to `false`:

```json
{
    "tp_comm_overlap": false
}
```

The tuner will automatically override this value during the tuning process.

### tp_comm_overlap_cfg.yaml
This file is automatically generated by the TP overlap tuner and should NOT be created manually. It contains the optimal SM allocation configuration discovered during tuning.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors about missing config files:
1. Verify files exist in this directory: `ls -l`
2. Check file permissions are readable
3. Ensure JSON files have valid syntax (use `python -m json.tool < file.json`)

For more details, see the main project documentation.
