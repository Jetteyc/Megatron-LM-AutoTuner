# About Implementation

If I only tell you requirements and let you freely coding, I can get nothing of your implementation, but I have thought about the best ways to get there. So Please:

1. Write your Design to a markdown file in [designs directory](../../vibe-coding-workspace/designs), let me read it, the design shall only about your architecture, your class design and function design which I can clearly get your thinking, or algorithms.
2. In your implementation, use Design Patterns, can re-use original classes to inherit.

I will put my requirements in [requirements directory](../../vibe-coding-workspace/requirements), I will use structured prompts CTCEFO.

- CONTEXT: [Describe the system, existing components, and requirements]

- CONSTRAINTS: [List any security, performance, or style requirements]
- EXAMPLES: [Provide similar code patterns from your codebase]
- FORMAT: [Specify code organization, naming conventions, etc.]
- OUTPUT: [Define what the response should include]
